# WotLK Items

Kind of a combination of AtlasLoot and EightyUpgrades.

Paste in your EightyUpgrades character to import your gear and stat weightings, and view a list of all items in an instance that are an upgrade for you, along with droprates.

At the moment (v0.2.0) there are a few outstanding issues - I know for a fact that the stat weighting values aren't 100% the same as eightyupgrades, only one set of stat equivalency points are displayed and (most importantly), tier tokens and sunmote-exchange items don't appear in loot tables. All things I'll get to!

Things still to do:

-   [x] Fix the WotLK loot tables
-   [x] Fix the broken instance names, boss names, etc.
-   [ ] Create exchange list (tier tokens, sunmotes, quest items e.g. verdant sphere, etc)
-   [x] Create dense, finalized equippable item list
-   [x] Put all the data in context, for easy access by any component
-   [ ] Figure out why some stat weightings are incorrect
-   [x] Make it possible to save a character for easy selection later (assuming nothing has changed on eightyupgrades)
-   [ ] Show all three stat weightings simultaneously
-   [x] Add in softres.it import for SR strategy values
