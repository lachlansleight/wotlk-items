# WotLK Items

Kind of a combination of AtlasLoot and EightyUpgrades.

Paste in your EightyUpgrades character to import your gear and stat weightings, and view a list of all items in an instance that are an upgrade for you, along with droprates.

Right now, it only uses your first set of stat weights, which is a little annoying. I'll get around to fixing that. :D

Things still to do:

-   [x] Fix the WotLK loot tables
-   [x] Fix the broken instance names, boss names, etc.
-   [x] Create exchange list (tier tokens, sunmotes, quest items e.g. verdant sphere, etc)
-   [x] Create dense, finalized equippable item list
-   [x] Put all the data in context, for easy access by any component
-   [x] Figure out why some stat weightings are incorrect
-   [x] Make it possible to save a character for easy selection later (assuming nothing has changed on eightyupgrades)
-   [ ] Show all three stat weightings simultaneously
-   [x] Add in softres.it import for SR strategy values
